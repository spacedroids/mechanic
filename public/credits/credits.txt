Things I learned
â€¢ Implementing the save functionality early helped me realize I needed to think through how I would serialize the state of the app. This led me to formalize a single place where I could store all the game objects in a way that they could be saved/loaded, but also iterated on to update and redraw as part of the game loop. This double purpose structure is very valuable.
